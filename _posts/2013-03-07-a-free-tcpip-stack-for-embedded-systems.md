Another awesome project I've been busy with:

I'm working for a company (TASS) that is specialized in embedded systems development and consultancy, and we have been working for quite some time on the PicoTCP project.

This is a TCP/IP stack, with a small footprint (so very suitable for embedded systems) and a very complete feature-set.
You can check it out for yourself, since it's free: (GPL v2, but dual-licensed should you want to use for your company)
[https://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp](https://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp)

Update: TASS/Altran seems to have abandoned the project, but it lives on as a GPL project here: [https://github.com/virtualsquare/picotcp](https://github.com/virtualsquare/picotcp)

We have demos of the stack running under linux with a virtual ethernet device (VDE), and on a whole bunch of development boards, such as the STM32F4 boards, a Ti Stellaris Board, a PIC24, ...

Check it out!
